# Sign-Off Notes
notes: |
  Comprehensive QA review of UI layout improvements completed. All changes are CSS-only modifications that expand container widths and reduce body padding for better screen space utilization.

  Key findings:
  - Zero functionality impacts
  - Zero accessibility regressions
  - Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance maintained
  - Responsive design integrity preserved
  - Design token compliance verified
  - All acceptance criteria met

  Risk assessment: LOW - Changes are additive (width expansions) or beneficial (padding reduction).

  Recommendation: PASS - Ready for production deployment. Suggest monitoring user feedback on mobile/tablet padding experience (16px → 8px) and ultra-wide monitor satisfaction (now supports 1920px+).
