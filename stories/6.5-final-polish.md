## Summary

Conduct comprehensive code review of the entire TriggersAPI codebase, optimize performance-critical paths, implement robust edge case handling, and achieve production readiness certification. Complete final validation that all 32 stories deliver complete, working, deployable functionality with zero data loss guarantees, sub-100ms latencies, comprehensive error handling, full type safety in TypeScript strict mode, accessibility compliance in UI, browser compatibility testing, security best practices verification, and production deployment readiness. Verify all stories 1.1-6.4 are properly integrated with no gaps or conflicts, establish performance baselines meet NFR targets, ensure all debug flags work correctly, validate complete audit trails exist, confirm observability is production-grade, and deliver system ready for enterprise showcase.

## Business Value

Production readiness certification provides confidence to stakeholders that TriggersAPI is enterprise-grade, battle-tested, and ready for real-world deployment. Comprehensive code review identifies technical debt, performance bottlenecks, and security gaps before launch. Optimization ensures system meets all NFR targets (100+ evt/s throughput, <100ms p95 latency, 99.9% reliability). Complete edge case handling prevents surprise failures during live demos or production usage. Full TypeScript strict mode compliance and accessibility compliance demonstrate engineering excellence. Browser compatibility testing ensures UI works across all modern browsers for demo audiences. Final polish story ensures every story delivers production-quality code with no shortcuts or TODOs. Establishes TriggersAPI as blueprint-worthy showcase of modern edge-native architecture.
